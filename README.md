# WavePlayer_AudioBuffer
C++ library to load, play and process a wave file. Part 1 of 3 of the Wave Player app

After compilation, the DLL and header file can be included in the project contained by the repo WavePlayer_COM to encapsulate the C++ code in a manner that is callable directly from C# code. This is necessary for the GUI (written in C#/Windows Presentation Foundation) to interact with this audio processing component.
